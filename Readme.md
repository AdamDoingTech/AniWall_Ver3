-- Hello, this is Adam from Atom Lab X 👨🏾‍💻

App Objective:<br>
* Download Anime wallpapers and images, with NO ADS or data collected.<br>
    
Project Overview:<br>
* 3rd version of the Anime Wallpaper App (Built Using SwiftUI From Scratch).<br>
* For a video Showcase of the app <a href="https://atomlabx.github.io/Images/AniWall.mp4">click here</a>.<br>
* I learn as I go.<br>
* Why version 3? - the second version was good, but I wanted to do a newer version using SwiftUI only,<br>because SwiftUI allow me to do margins/constraints more efficiently.<br>

What Did I Learn So Far?<br>
* SwiftUI does the constrains by itself.
* A Navigation inside, a Navigation, can cause the app on iPad to look weird.
* How to work and setup MVVM.

Contribution Guidelines:<br>
* Feedback is welcome (To improve the application).<br>

See you on the other side! 👋🏾
