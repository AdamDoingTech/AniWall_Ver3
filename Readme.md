-- Hello, this is Adam from Atom Lab X 👨🏾‍💻

Project Overview:<br>
    * 3rd version of the Anime Wallpaper App (Built Using SwiftUI From Scratch).<br>
    * Video Showcase for the project <a href="https://atomlabx.github.io/Images/AniWall.mp4">Here </a>.
    <br>
    * It is a fun project (I learn as I go).<br>
    * Why version 3? - the second version was good, but I wanted to do a newer version using SwiftUI only, because SwiftUI allow me to do margins/constraints more efficiently.<br>

Contribution Guidelines:<br>
    * Feedback is welcome (To improve the application).<br>
    * No forking allowed (In the meantime).

See you on the other side! 👋🏾
