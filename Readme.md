## REASONS BEHIND THE APP:
As an Anime enthusiast, I wanted to build something to show my love for Anime, so I chose an Anime Wallpapers App. Because all Anime Wallpaper Apps have ads. Also very challenging or slow to use.<br>
Therefore, I built AniWall with no ads or data collected, with blazing speed, and a sleek UI/UX.<br>
