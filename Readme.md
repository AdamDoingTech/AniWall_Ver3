-- Hello, this is Adam from Atom Lab X 👨🏾‍💻

Project Overview:<br>
    * 3nd Ver of Anime Wallpaper App (Built Using SwiftUI From Scratch).<br>
    * It is a fun project (I learn as I go).<br>
    * Why Ver 3? - The second ver was good, but I wanted to do a newer version using SwiftUI only.<br>

Contribution Guidelines:<br>
    * Feedback is welcome (To improve the App).<br>
    * No forking allowed in the meantime.

See you on the other side! 👋🏾
