## IDEA BEHIND THE APP:
As an Anime enthusiast, I wanted to build something to show my love for Anime, so I chose an Anime Wallpapers App.<br>
Because all Anime Wallpaper Apps have ads. Also very challenging or slow to use.<br>
Therefore, I built AniWall with no ads or data collected, with sleek UI/UX.<br>
